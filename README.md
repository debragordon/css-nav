## Description
We were tasked to apply various CSS styling to an interactive Navigation bar.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo to your local computer

3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser to view the css in action (preferably open in Google Chrome) and a cute picture of my dog Della Mae
